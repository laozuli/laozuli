### Hello Visitor!

I'm Sophie and this is my personal github for projects I work on in my spare time. I decided to make a new account so that my personal stuff was not linked to all my work repos.
[I have a site](http://laozuli.com) (which doesn't do much at the moment so watch this space)

**About**
- 🎢 I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer in MLOps
- ⚙️ Languages: mostly `python` a bit of `golang` and learning `c++`
<!---
laozuli/laozuli is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
